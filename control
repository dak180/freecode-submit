Description: submit release information to freshmeat.net
 freshmeat-submit is a script that supports remote submission of
 release updates to Freshmeat via its JSON API.  It is intended for use
 in project release scripts.  It reads the metadata from an
 RFC-2822-like message on standard input, possibly with overrides by
 command-line switches.
