This is a test release dummy being used to check if the new
implementation of freshmeat-submit actually works with the 3.0 API
before releasing it as 2.0.  Subscribers should ignore it; freshmeat
admins, you can delete it out of the queue but please email me at
esr@thyrsus.com to inform me that it arrived and of any errors in
processing.
