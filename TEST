GPSD-NG, the new JSON-based command protocol, is now deployed; as a
consequence, AIS is now fully supported in both daemon and client.
Detection of end of a fix-reporting cycle is now reliable; accordingly
data is accumulated from cycle start and the "J" (nojitter) option on
both server and client side is gone. We have abandoned the gpsflash
subproject since it has become apparent that we can't do it without
more vendor cooperation than we're likely to get. Increase major
version of shared library due to significant API change. Added new
driver for Motorola Oncore receivers, with help from HÃ¥kan
Johansson. gpsfake can now accept multiple logfiles, interleaving test
sentences from each.  gpsd now accepts error estimates from the NMEA
$GPGBS sentence.
